## Getting Started
To run this sample:

Clone the repository from github:
```
$ git clone git@github.com:anychart-integrations/anychart-react-native.git
```

Navigate to the repository folder:
```
$ cd anychart-react-native
```

Install all project requirements:
```
sudo npm install
```

Now you can start a development server for you:
```
sudo npm start
```

At this stage you will see the development server interface which allows to launch the demo application on emulators or on real mobile devices using the [EXPO client](https://expo.io/).

## Mobile Apps

### Emulators

To run the the mobile applications on emulators, please, install required emulators:
 - [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/) with built-in emulator for Android
 - [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) with built-in emulator for iOS

Run the target device emulator.

Run the emulator by choosing required option in the development server interface.

### EXPO client

To run the the mobile applications on a real device, please, install the EXPO client:
 - [for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent)
 - [for iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/expo-client/id982107779?mt=8)

Use your device camera to scan the QR code provided by the development server interface. It opens the EXPO client to build and download the the demo application. It will launch the demo application as the JavaScript bundle get downloaded.
